Jesse's Learning Journal
========================

This is my repo containing different parts of my learning journal. To solve the four latest issues, I used forms to pass all of my get and post params. Thanks to Scott Schmidt for showing me how to filter a query from a database.

Mockups
-------

My mockups folder contains the four primary pages of my journal: index.html, create.html, detail.html, and edit.html. These pages all relate to each other, but don't interact with each other as mockups, except for the navigation links. My styles for these pages are found in the main.css file in the css folder.

Templates
---------

My templates folder includes the html docs that are deployed for my learning journal site. The templates are in jinja2 format.

journal.py
----------

The module journal.py is the file that stores my deployed app.

AJAX and Twitter
----------------

If javascript is enabled, the site will submit changes via AJAX. I referred to Jon Duckett's book, and Jonathan Stallings helped resolve bugs. 

Duckett, J., & Ruppert, G. (n.d.). *JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive front-end web development*.


The site now includes a twitter button.
