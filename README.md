Jesse's Learning Journal
========================

This is my repo containing different parts of my learning journal.

Mockups
-------

My mockups folder contains the four primary pages of my journal: index.html, create.html, detail.html, and edit.html. These pages all relate to each other, but don't interact with each other as mockups, except for the navigation links. My styles for these pages are found in the main.css file in the css folder.
